# mpy-modcore - a micro framework for MicroPython

An approach to modularize MicroPython projects.

Introduce a defined lifecycle and eventing model
for modules / devices for convenient handling
of loose coupled modules/ devices

# What's new ?

Check
[`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for latest ongoing, or upcoming news


# Web Server included

In package `modext.http` there are basic HTTP request handling functions.

In package `modext.windup` is WindUp as included web server.

The WindUp web server is like 
[Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server)
based on the concept of 
[`Filter and Content Generator`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/filter.html). 
What makes WindUp easy extensible; and flexible how requests are processed.

WindUp comes already with a bunch of Filters, e.g. HTML Form data parser, 
JSON processing, Query parameter extraction, Cookies, 
Session handling (in-memory), REST stlye URL parameter parser, and extraction, etc.

Multi-tasking processing support of HTTP requests based on fiber 
([`source`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/modext/fiber/fiber_worker.py)).

Static Files and JSON response data is processed in fibered mode.
Anyway user code is free to redefine this behaviour by setting the `fibered`
parameter to `False` on request base.

WindUp is in Alpha state and not performance optimized. 
Anyway response times under 1 secs are already possible.

### Secure Role based Access to URL Routes 

WindUp supports you to write Role based applications, with a minimal side effort.
Refer to the additional `Login/Logout` module under `mod3rd` on how to use this.


### New to fiber ?

Like an async coroutine is a fiber an approach of cooperative multitasking.
Whereas objectives are the same.

Pros and Cons? 
Read more on wikipedia about
[`fiber`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science))


#### Do i need to fiber my code ?

No. Serve traditional as you go, or fiber the code.


# Platform

Tested on ESP32 with PSRam and ESP8266 (for latter, see limitations below)

## Development status

Alpha state.
The API or logical call flow might change without prior notice.

In case your code breaks between two versions check
[`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
information first before creating a ticket / issue on github. thanks.


# Limitations

- ~~no asyncio integration as of now~~
- with all mod's enabled as shown here in the sample
 it will not run on ESP8266 due to memory limit.
 but wlan, softap, and ntp should work 


# Sample Code

Some sample code can be found in
[`boot.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/boot.py)
and under [`samples`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/tree/master/samples).

In order to run the samples sync the folder `www` and `etc` from github to the local
project folder from where running the samples.
If running together with `boot.py` check for `run_not_in_sample_mode` and
set to `False` to prevent autostarting WindUp and blocking the socket,
or provide your own `boot.py`.

In oder to run the unsuported modules from the `mod3rd` folder download
this folder from github to the local project folder.

There are hints how to use or test with `curl`,
all using URL `http://your-ip/...`.
Add the following to `/etc/hosts` to use them more easily.
e.g. when your device has the following IP address:

    192.168.178.26    your-ip
    

# Reference proof-of-concept project 

the garden watering project [`mpymodcore_watering`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore_watering)
is the reference proof-of-concept project for `mpy-modcode`.

it covers in detail:
    
- usage of modcore modules
- modcore eventing modell
- REST / ajax based application development
- HTML / javascript  user interface devlopment
- single page app devlopment with 3rd party tools:
  - [`vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/)
  - [`bootstrap`](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - [`fontawesome`](https://fontawesome.com/)


# Related project

`mpy-modcore` is the successor of [mpyconfigbase](https://github.com/kr-g/mpyconfigbase)

# Installation

- with pip (recommended)

    `# install to the current (project) folder`
    
    `python3 -m pip install mpymodcore --no-compile --target .` 
     
 
Add the `mpy-modcore` folders to your `.gitignore`
